    <h2 id="admin-rights">admin rights</h2>
    <p>
        We have made it to the point where we can <i>all</i> agree that dedicated accounts should be used to administer servers and for that, I am grateful.
        How admin rights are actually <i>assigned</i> is another matter entirely and it all starts with how Active Directory is (or is not) organized.
        I have seen AD hierarchies where 1,000+ servers all reside in three OUs and on the opposite end of the spectrum, more OUs than servers to actually <i>use</i> them.
        This probably made sense when you had 12 servers total...

        <i>"So what is the 'right' way to structure an OU for servers?"</i> I'm glad you asked. In the example below the db, sec, and web OUs correspond to the <u>teams</u>
        which administer the servers within. In every large Active Directory environment I have seen, regardless of the number of applications or different classes of servers,
        it usually comes down to a dozen or so unique business units who have any business with admin rights on servers. I have implemented this structure in real-world
        Active Directory, it makes the assignment and auditing of admin rights effortless, exactly as it should be.

        The GPO savvy will already know the next steps; using the previous example you would create three GPOs named something like, <b>Local Admins - db</b>,
        <b>Local Admins - sec</b>, and <b>Local Admins - web</b>. Each GPO has the Administrators group defined with a single group corresponding to the admin accounts for that
        business unit, and is then attached to the corresponding OU. <i>"But what about the Systems Administrators? They need admin rights on everything!"</i> Okay...
        so create another GPO named <b>Local Admins - all</b>, define the members of the Administrators group, and attach that to the top-most servers OU. Done.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>"I actually have a clever way to assign admin groups to every server using a single GPO."</i><br><br>
        I'll bet you do. I know exactly what you're going to say; you'll create a group for <u>each</u> server in the environment, then you'll create a GPO which defines the 
        Administrator group using variables, something like <b>%DOMAINNAME%\Admins-%COMPUTERNAME%</b>. That will absolutely work, and yes, it makes auditing admin rights on
        servers a simple matter of querying AD group membership. There are several things you should consider before implementing this method.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you have 90 servers in the same 'class', why would a user need admin rights on only a subset of them?
        </li>
        <li>
            What happens when your junior admin provisions a new server and forgets to create and populate the group?
        </li>
        <li>
            You realize there are only so many SIDs in Active Directory...right?
        </li>
        <li>
            What happens when a user is a member of 1,000+ groups?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Run the PowerShell script below <u>in your lab environment</u>, then try logging into any domain machine with username <b>neo</b> and password <b>Thematrixhasyou69!</b>

        You got the error below, didn't you? I hope Microsoft never "fixes" this.
