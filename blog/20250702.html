    <p>
        A friend and I were discussing Active Directory and DFS namespaces following some strange behavior on his network. Basically, while working from his home office in
        Vegas, DFS namespaces and folder targets behaved as expected serving data from the file server at the Vegas location. However, when working from the Elko office the
        DFS namespaces and folder targets were selected seemingly at random, with data being served from either the file server at the Vegas location <i>or</i> the file server
        at the Reno location, which in this case, was not desirable as the link between Elko and Reno was a low-speed, high-latency "backup" link. The environment exists as
        outlined below.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Site</th>
            <th>Subnet</th>
            <th>Server</th>
        </tr>

            <td>Carson</td>
            <td>192.168.1.0/24</td>
            <td>DC01 (Domain Controller)</td>

    <p>
        <i>What does AD Sites and Services look like? Are all the sites and subnets there?</i>
        <br>
        They were and the domain controllers were associated with the correct sites. Good start.

    <p>
        <i>How about the Inter-Site Transports? Are links defined properly where site connectivity exists?</i>
        <br>
        Only <b>DEFAULTSITELINK</b> exists and the sites associated with it are those with domain controllers. Problem.

        <i>What do the DFS namespaces look like?</i>
        <br>
        One namespace and folders within, easy enough.

    <p>
        <i>What about the folder targets, and how are they accessed?</i>
        <br>
        The Reno office only accesses the <b>reno</b> DFS folder target. Similarly, the Vegas office only accesses the <b>vegas</b> DFS folder target.

    <p>
        My friend had already found the DFS folder target "Advanced" configuration to override referral ordering. Given how the DFS folder targets were being accessed, this
        was going to be the quick and dirty fix for his issue. The <b>reno</b> folder on <b>fs01</b> would be first priority among all targets. The <b>vegas</b> folder
        on <b>fs02</b> would be first priority among all targets. Now this <i>only</i> works because of the use case presented here. If for some reason users in Reno were
        accessing the <b>vegas</b> DFS folder target, they would likely complain that doing so is slow.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/20250702/05.png"><img src="/assets/images/20250702/05.png"></a>
    <a href="/assets/images/20250702/06.png"><img src="/assets/images/20250702/06.png"></a>
    <p>
        Time to test. I dropped my Windows 11 client on the Reno network and accessed the <b>vegas</b> DFS folder target. As expected, the folder was served from <b>fs02</b>,
        the file server in Vegas even though <b>fs01</b> which exists in the same site and subnet as the client also has this folder target configured in an enabled state.
        Run <b>dfsutil.exe /pktflush</b> any number of times and the folder target remains on the same server so long as it is available.

    <p>
        <i>How do we fix this properly?</i>
        <br>
        We can start with reverting the referral ordering for DFS folder targets back to the default state, then Inter-Site Transports need some attention. We worked out
        where network links exist between sites and determined the speed for each of the links. The table below outlines what we had to work with.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Link</th>
            <th>Mbit/s</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Carson ◄--► Reno</td>
            <td>155</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Elko ◄--► Vegas</td>
            <td>155</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Carson ◄--► Elko</td>
            <td>51</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Carson ◄--► Vegas</td>
            <td>6.3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Elko ◄--► Reno</td>
            <td>6.3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        T-2... what year is this?! At any rate, we created IP links with costs that reflected the speeds of the links, associated the sites exactly as you would expect,
        then removed the <b>DEFAULTSITELINK</b>. Below is what the IP Inter-Site Transport configuration looks like now. Following this change DFS namespaces and folder
        targets are served just as Bill Gates intended;  based upon the "cost" of getting <i>to</i> the file server.

        <i>Wait... how do you configure cost for OneDrive?</i>
        <br>
        There are things we will never know.
