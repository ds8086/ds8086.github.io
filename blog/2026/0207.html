        Copilot; the AI is quickly becoming inescapable in the Microsoft landscape. Several products have undergone re-branding in order to
        shoehorn <i>copilot</i> into the name. Lenovo has rearranged their keyboards to make room for the new dedicated copilot key. If you
        have "upgraded" to Windows 11 you will find copilot in the latest iteration of notepad and even paint. What would Ballmer say?

        I was recently linked to a <a href="https://x.com/linusgsebastian/status/2015948530578587699" target="_blank">post on X</a> citing
        a Microsoft sign-in prompt while attempting to use paint. I don't know the full story here, I'm not actually <i>on</i> X.†
        It did set me on a quest to recreate the reported issue. I was curious, what did this individual <i>do</i> which led to the sign-in prompt?

        I made that picture using paint in Windows 11. When I launched paint, I was not hit with a Microsoft sign-in prompt. I used the
        newly incorporated <i>Generative erase</i> and <i>Remove background</i> tools and did so without entering Microsoft credentials.
        As for the tools, they work about as well you'd expect. Operating system aside, it's paint, keep expectations low.

        I ran <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer" target="_blank">ProcessExplorer</a> while
        using the <i>Generative erase</i> and <i>Remove background</i> tools. I wanted to see if any child processes were spawned by paint
        or if any packets left my machine because of paint. There was no network traffic, I even disabled my network interface and verified
        that the two "erase" tools still functioned. What about the last new tool?

        There's the sign-in prompt! It makes sense though, generating an image is completely different than erasing bits of an existing
        one. This <i>must</i> connect to a generative AI service so as you would expect, clicking <b>sign-in</b> generates network traffic...
        from <i>paint</i>. What a time to be alive...

        In all previous iterations of Windows, you'd find <b>mspaint.exe</b> and its corresponding MUI file in <b>System32</b>. Hopefully
        you have kept installation media for your favorite deprecated Windows OS...

        ...those applications still run on Windows 11. Behold paint, circa 2009. Feast your eyes on that <i>classic</i> task manager running
        in the Windows 11 Night Sky contrast theme. I have to give Microsoft credit; the high contrast themes in Windows 11 are on-point.

        I had originally planned on copying executable and MUI files from Windows 10 for this demo. I even provisioned a Windows 10 machine in my
        lab. This. <i>This</i> is the operating system which everyone misses? Just look at the bloatware Windows 10 would install had
        I given the machine internet access. Was Windows 10 better than 11? Yes. Does that make it <i>good</i>? No.
    </p>

        I bring up Windows 7 more often than I probably should. It dates me. It makes me feel like an old man yelling at clouds. However, it is
        not without good reason; Windows 7 was <u>peak</u> Microsoft desktop OS in my opinion. It booted in seconds, it was performant, and most
        importantly, it was an OS stripped to the <i>bone</i>. While you can <i>make</i> Windows 10 good, good out-of-the-box it was not. You can
        even <a href="https://github.com/ds8086/Windows11" target="_blank">make Windows 11 tolerable</a> but tolerable is not <i>good</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back when I was charged with deploying Windows 7 en masse, the first modifications to the base OS were <u>additions</u>; drivers,
        applications, and customization. With Windows 10, there was a paradigm shift. The first task had now become execution of a debloat or
        "decrapifier" script on your freshly installed Windows OS. Windows 11 is a furtherance of this mindset... except with the added bloat of AI
        and less control granted to administrators.

        Microsoft recently published
        <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2026/01/09/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-7535-dev-beta-channels" target="_blank">an article</a>
        stating that copilot will soon be removable via an admin controlled policy on Windows 11 Enterprise, Pro, and Educational SKUs. Even more recently,
        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/870045/microsoft-windows-11-issues-rebuilding-trust-notepad" target="_blank">The Verge</a> has cited
        Microsoft as pulling engineers from other projects in order to concentrate efforts on fixing Windows 11.‡ Should this prove to be true,
        it will hopefully bring much needed stability and usability improvements to Windows 11. Personally, I want an <u>official</u> Windows 11
        <a href="https://tiny11.net/" target="_blank">minimal installation</a> option.
