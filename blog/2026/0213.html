        I do not recall <i>exactly</i> when I started playing Minecraft, I remember horses being big news at some point though... I rarely play
        any more, but on occasion I wax nostalgic. Someone will spin up a Spigot or Paper server with the latest in quality of life mods and
        we will spend a few weeks building, mining, and trying to recall potion recipes. My second-hand precision workstation has 64GB of RAM
        and a decent nvidia Quadro GPU. Minecraft runs great...but almighty CMOS! Deliver me from the Microsoft provided Minecraft launcher.
        The fans spin up, videos start playing, and I am bombarded with opportunities to spend money on a game I already purchased.† It is
        sensory overload. I think about it and my interest to play Minecraft evaporates. Let's fix that.
    </p>
    <h3 id="installation">installation</h3>
    <p>
        Run the Minecraft launcher as you normally would. From the Installations tab find your desired Minecraft version and click <b>Play</b>.
        Why version 1.7.10 for me? The last major release before Microsoft bought Mojang.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2026/0213/01.png"><img src="/assets/images/2026/0213/01.png"></a>
    <p>
        With Minecraft launched, leave the game sitting on the title screen.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2026/0213/02.png"><img src="/assets/images/2026/0213/02.png"></a>
    <h3 id="batch">batch</h3>
    <p>
        Launch a PowerShell 7 instance and run the command below to create the batch file which will later be used to launch your selected Minecraft
        installation.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
(Get-Process javaw).CommandLine | Out-File ~\Desktop\minecraft.bat
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h3 id="account">account</h3>
    <p>
        If Minecraft is the <u>only</u> reason your Microsoft account exists in Windows, then why not remove it? Open Windows settings
        via <b>Win + i</b> and navigate to Accounts > Your accounts. Locate your Microsoft account and click <b>Remove</b>.‡
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2026/0213/03.png"><img src="/assets/images/2026/0213/03.png"></a>
    <p>
        With your Microsoft account removed from Windows, run the Minecraft launcher again. This is to demonstrate that while you are <u>not</u> signed
        in via a Microsoft account, you can still play Minecraft. You will be prompted for a Microsoft sign-in, just close the prompt via the <b>X</b>.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2026/0213/04.png"><img src="/assets/images/2026/0213/04.png"></a>
    <p>
        The Minecraft launcher will continue but you will quickly be met with another sign-in prompt. Close the Minecraft Launcher.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2026/0213/05.png"><img src="/assets/images/2026/0213/05.png"></a>
    <h3 id="play">play</h3>
    <p>
        Time to play Minecraft! Double-click the previously created batch file on your desktop or run the PowerShell command below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
Start-Process -Path ~\Desktop\minecraft.bat -WindowStyle Hidden
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Look at that; Minecraft without a Microsoft sign-in and without the official launcher.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> Is this illegal?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> I'm an engineer, not an attorney. Many third-party Minecraft launchers exist, you've just made your own.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> What if I want a different version?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Repeat the process, update the name of the batch file created.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> What if I want the <i>latest</i> version?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Use a Minecraft launcher, either official or third-party. This solution isn't really for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> Can I connect to Minecraft servers?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Probably. I haven't tried yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> What about Bedrock edition?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> I don't know how to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> Could I use the information in the batch file to create a "point-in-time" Minecraft bundle?
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> What an interesting idea...
    </p>

        † I bought Minecraft before Microsoft did. <s>Don't copy that floppy</s>. Don't pirate software.

        ‡ Someday soon, Microsoft will require sign-in for Windows OS. Fedora anyone?
