    <p>
        In just the past few months, Microsoft has published patches which have caused widespread failures for core Windows Server services.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/june-10-2025-kb5060526-os-build-20348-3807-4e9453c4-6602-48ea-b349-689cd66dfdb9" target="_blank">KB5060526</a>:
            Released in June 2025, broke DHCP on Windows Server 2022.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-8-2025-kb5062557-os-build-17763-7558-9a2cd65b-c7a7-4331-87c4-84790511f6fe" target="_blank">KB5062557</a>:
            Released in July 2025, caused Cluster service and VM restarts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-8-2025-kb5062152-cumulative-update-for-net-framework-3-5-4-7-2-and-4-8-for-windows-10-version-1809-and-windows-server-2019-6c2444d5-f73a-44c8-b8dc-b1e4f5f9fec7" target="_blank"">KB5062152</a>:
            <i>Also</i> released in July 2025, bad metadata caused a full sync of every WSUS server worldwide...
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ...yes, Microsoft released an update which DDoS'd their own infrastructure. Wondering how we got here? Remember,
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=microsoft+30%25+of+code+written+by+AI&t=h_&ia=web" target="_blank">up to 30% of Microsoft's code is now written by AI</a>. A statement which will
        likely haunt Satya Nadella every patch Tuesday for the rest tenure as CEO. The issues caused by these updates were bad, but think about how much
        <i>worse</i> it could be. What happens when Kerberos breaks? Imagine that Wednesday morning phone call, no one can authenticate to the domain, every system in your
        environment which relies upon Active Directory is just dead in the water. This eventuality is one AI hallucination away. Windows powered Active Directory has been
        and will likely remain the de facto authentication mechanism because TINA, there is no alternative...<i>right?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sure, you could ditch on-premises Active Directory in favor of <s>Azure AD</s> Entra ID. Just go all-in with Microsoft cloud services, they will happily take your money
        and should the service availability fall below the mythical five-9s, you will get a service credit for your trouble. Just imagine <i>that</i> conversation with
        your leadership. <i>"Microsoft apologizes for the Entra ID outage which cost us sales revenue. It is fixed now, and they have given us a service credit."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Doomsday soothsaying aside, what alternative is there <i>really</i>? A long time ago, in a company merger far far away... I learned that you can run Active Directory
        on Linux. You read that correctly; a Linux based domain controller with all the AD capabilities your business requires*. Search this subject online and you will be
        met with a mob of sysadmins trying to convince you why you <i>should not</i> endeavor to implement this. The seemingly evergreen topic is perpetually focused on
        Microsoft licensing costs. Many who would consider running Active Directory on Linux are responsible for small environments with even <i>smaller</i> budgets. The
        sysadmins who <i>might</i> consider a Linux powered AD domain are dissuaded from doing so usually due to the complexity of setup and management.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the famous words of Jeremy Clarkson; <i>"How hard could it be?"</i>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 7pt;">
        * Provided you can make due with a forest functionality level of Windows Server 2008r2.

    <p>
        Below is the materials list for this little foray into the twilight zone.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_an_Active_Directory_Domain_Controller" target="_blank">Samba documentation</a></li>

    <h3 id="distro">distro</h3>
    <p>
        Since the death of centos, I have adopted <a href="https://almalinux.org/" target="_blank">AlmaLinux</a> as my distribution of choice for all things Linux in my home
        lab. Up until <i>today</i> it has met every one of my needs, be it a squid proxy, a Minecraft server, or a Docker host. It turns out that RHEL and its relative distros
        do not provide the packages for running Samba as a domain controller. The first hurdle before even leaving the starting gate. Upon finding this, I am met with
        a short list of options.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Build Samba from source and configure it manually.</li>
        <li>Use a 3rd party repo which hosts the required packages.</li>
        <li>Run a different distro.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By its very nature, the project places me well outside of my Windows comfort zone. Building from source would undoubtedly yield more of a learning opportunity, but
        also carries the increased risk of, <i>"Nuts to this, I'm gonna to play video games"</i>. Someday, perhaps, but not today. A 3rd party repo could work, but I'm not
        deep enough into the Linux weeds to know of any trustworthy repos for this niche purpose. Another distro it is, but which one?
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Distribution-specific_Package_Installation" target="_blank">documentation</a> has a short list distros with specific
        package installation instructions; Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD, or openSUSE. I have a weird view on Ubuntu; I've used it previously for a few things, it has solid
        documentation and community provided support. I just... don't care for it. Too many YAML files? Easy mode Linux? Perhaps it is just my contrarian nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>"Debian. Familiar package manager but different enough to be... different. Oh good, there is a minimal option. Sold."</i>

    <p>
        Here is the plan for the Debian powered domain controller.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Hostname</td>
            <td>dc01</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>IP addr</td>
            <td>192.168.1.10/24</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AD domain</td>
            <td>ad.lab.local</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Next... next... next through the graphical install of Debian 12, reboot, and SSH in. Here we go.
    </p>
    <h3 id="prep-work">prep work</h3>
    <p>
        First step: check for updates and install <b>vim</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install vim -y
        </code>
    </pre>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/01.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/01.png"></a>
    <p>
        Whoa... it does not include the packages required for <b>sudo</b>. Now <i>that's</i> minimal! This will be fun.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
su -
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Take two: updates and <b>vim</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
apt-get update -y
apt-get install vim -y
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        We'll need static a static IP address for this to work. Backup the config file, then edit it.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
cp /etc/network/interfaces ~/interfaces.bak
vim /etc/network/interfaces
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        <b>Before</b>
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/02.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/02.png"></a>
    <p>
        <b>After</b>
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/03.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/03.png"></a>
    <p>
        The networking service must be bounced following the change.
        <br>
        <i>"Did I fat finger the gateway?"</i>
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
systemctl restart networking.service
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        The DC must resolve both its own FQDN and hostname.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
echo "192.168.1.10    dc01.ad.lab.local       dc01" >> /etc/hosts
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        With that, the DC is ready for package installation and configuration. Probably a good time to shutdown and snapshot the VM.
    </p>
    <h3 id="install">install</h3>
    <p>
        Package installation is a snap. During installation the interactive configuration for Samba fires off, I just left everything blank and <i>OK'd</i> through each
        of the prompts. The Samba config will be removed and recreated properly during the domain provisioning process anyway.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
apt-get install acl attr samba winbind libpam-winbind libnss-winbind krb5-config krb5-user dnsutils python3-setproctitle ntp -y
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Next step: configure Samba. Another good opportunity to shutdown and snapshot the VM.
    </p>
    <h3 id="configure">configure</h3>
    <p>
        The Samba config created during package installation can be removed, might as well back it up first though right?
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
cp /etc/samba/smb.conf ~/smb.conf.bak
rm /etc/samba/smb.conf
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        On to provisioning the domain. I was expecting the <b>@</b> in the password to cause issues, thankfully  it did not.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
samba-tool domain provision --server-role=dc --use-rfc2307 --dns-backend=SAMBA_INTERNAL --realm=AD.LAB.LOCAL --domain=AD --adminpass=P@ssw0rd!
        </code>
    </pre>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/04.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/04.png"></a>
    <p>
        A wall of mostly green text would seem to indicate success. Next, the DNS resolver config needs updating as well. With nothing worthy of backup, slam two
        lines into the file and move on with life.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
echo "search ad.lab.local" > /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 192.168.1.10" >> /etc/resolv.conf
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Next, the <a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_an_Active_Directory_Domain_Controller#Configuring_Kerberos" target=" _blank">documentation</a>
        says to copy the <b>krb5.conf</b> file created during domain provisioning to the operating system Kerberos configuration. Referring to the wall of green text we
        see where the file was created and run the command below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
cp /var/lib/samba/private/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        At this point the Samba service can actually be <i>started</i> and made to start automatically.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
systemctl start samba
systemctl enable samba
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Active Directory is nothing without DNS, a fact that easily carries over from Windows to Linux. The commands below will create a reverse lookup zone and a PTR
        record <i>within</i> the zone for the domain controller. This is also a good test for your DNS resolver configuration.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
samba-tool dns zonecreate dc01 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa -U Administrator
samba-tool dns add dc01 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa 10 PTR dc01.ad.lab.local -U Administrator
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h3 id="verify">verify</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_an_Active_Directory_Domain_Controller#Verifying_the_File_Server_(Optional)" target="_blank">documentation</a>
        has a step to verify file server functionality using <b>smbclient</b>. Depending on how <i>minimal</i> your distro is, you may or may not have this package... I do not.
        I can, however, verify DNS resolution using the code below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.ad.lab.local
host -t SRV _kerberos._tcp.ad.lab.local
host -t A dc01.ad.lab.local
host -t PTR 192.168.1.10
        </code>
    </pre>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/05.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/05.png"></a>
    <p>
        Each query gave an answer, that seems good. What about Kerberos, does it work?
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
kinit administrator
        </code>
    </pre>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/06.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/06.png"></a>
    <p>
        If I am being told when my password expires I <i>must</i> be successfully authenticated, but let's list Kerberos tickets.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
klist
        </code>
    </pre>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/07.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/07.png"></a>
    <p>
        We have a functional Active Directory domain controller! <b>\o/</b>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="desktop">desktop</h2>
    <p>
        Now to verify that a desktop OS can join the newly minted domain. Since the forest functionality level for this implementation is Server 2008r2, how about
        a <i>period authentic</i> desktop? Arguably one of the last great desktop operating systems from Microsoft; Windows 7 SP1.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/08.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/08.png"></a>
    <p>
        <b>&lt;rant&gt;</b>
        <br>
        Never forget, Microsoft once gave us a desktop operating system which...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contained <u>no</u> bloatware.</li>
        <li>Booted in under a minute.</li>
        <li>Had a functional start menu.</li>
        <li>Ran <u>tens</u> of processes, not hundreds.</li>
        <li>Did this all in less than 1GB of memory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ...More "features" should never mean less usability.
        <br>
        <b>&lt;/rant&gt;</b>
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/09.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/09.png"></a>
    <p>
        It was also able to join the domain. <b>\o/</b>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="server">server</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to the fine vintage of Windows 7, I wanted to ensure that a modern OS could join the domain. For those of you who have not memorized the <b>win32</b>
        operating system class version numbers, I selected Windows Server 2022, which also joined the domain without issue.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/10.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/10.png"></a>
    <p>
        With a few RSAT management tools installed, let's see what this Windows server has to say about the domain it has just joined.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/11.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/11.png"></a>
    <p>
        Ah, the PowerShell module does not work. I suppose this <i>would</i> be expecting a lot given the circumstances. Remember, this domain is running what is largely
        considered bootleg Active Directory. All is not lost though, the tried and true <b>ds*</b> commands such as <b>dsquery</b> are functional so you would
        <i>technically</i> have programmatic management capabilities. Prepare to visit <a href="https://ss64.com/nt/" target="_blank">ss64.com</a> more frequently.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/12.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/12.png"></a>
    <p>
        In all reality, if you were to implement Linux powered Active Directory, it would (hopefully) be at a very small scale where management would likely take place via
        a GUI. The Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in is exactly what you would expect and accurately shows both the desktop and the server domain members.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/13.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/13.png"></a>
    <p>
        There it is. In all of its strange and not yet fully understood splendor, the Debian powered domain controller.
    </p>
    <a href="/assets/images/2025/0811/14.png"><img src="/assets/images/2025/0811/14.png"></a>
    <p>
        A quick look in DNS provides a familiar sight with the expected AD integrated forward lookup zone, created during the domain provisioning process as well as the
        reverse lookup zone which was created later on. Both <b>ws01</b> and <b>srv01</b> have dynamically updated their corresponding DNS records just as you would expect.
        If you read my <a href="/blog/2025/0804.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, you should be able to explain both how and why.
